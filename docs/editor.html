    <h1>Apex Command Language Overview</h1>

    <p> Lots of people were intrigued by my reference to my editor
    project. </p>
    
    <p> So. The language for my editor is sort of a combination of TECO
      and Sam. Once the basic system is working, I'm planning on a UI that's
      modeled on Acme. For now, I'm going to focus on the language.</p>

    
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    
    <p> My goals for the language are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> <b>Conciseness</b>: since I'm planning on using this for all of
	my everyday programming, it's really important for it to be
	concise. It doesn't matter if it's easy to read if I need to type
	something like <code>forall match in regexp.match("foo") do
	  match.replace("bar") end</code>. It's just too damned much typing
	for an everyday task. In what I describe below, a global search
	and replace is <code>g/foo/,{r'bar'}</code>.</li>
      
      <li> <b>Consistency</b>: everything works in roughly the same
	way.  Everything can succeed or fail, and all of the semantics
	are based around that idea. Everything that takes parameters
	takes parameters in the same way. If something works in one
	context, it'll work in another.
      </li>
      
      <li> <b>Clarity</b>: if you look at the code fragments below, this
	one takes a bit of explanation. The conciseness of the syntax
	means that to someone who isn't familiar with the language, it's
	going to be absolutely impossible to read. But the way that things
	work is straightforward, and so once you understand the basic
	ideas of the syntax, you can easily read a program. It's not like
	TECO where you need to know the specific command in order to have
	a clue of what it does. And the parser can look at an entire
	program, and tell you before executing any of it whether it's got
	a syntax error.</li>
    </ol>
    
<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p> The syntax for commands is: </p>
	
<pre>
stmt: sub | command
	
sub: 'sub'  sub_params FUN_IDENT sub_params '{' command '}'

sub_params : '(' ( VAR_IDENT ( ',' VAR_IDENT )*  )?  ')' 

command : choice_command ( '?' simple_command ':' simple_command )

choice_command : seq_command ('|' seq_command)*
	
seq_command : simple_command ( '.' simple_command )*
	
simple_command : atomic_command
               | '[' command ']'


atomic_command: ( params )? command_name ( post_params )?
	      |  params '!' VAR_IDENT

post_params: post_param (',' post_param)*

post_param: QUOTED_STRING
          | PATTERN
          | block
          | '$(' expr ')'
	
params	: NUMERIC_LITERAL
        | '(' ( expr ( ',' expr )* )? ')'
	 
quoted_param: QUOTE_CHAR  ( NON_QUOTE_CHAR )* QUOTE_CHAR
            | '(' expr ')'
	

expr : NUMERIC_LITERAL
     | QUOTED_STRING
     | funcall
     | block
     | command
     | VAR_IDENT

	
funcall: params FUN_IDENT ( quoted_param )?
	
block : '{' ( '|'  VAR_IDENT (',' VAR_IDENT)*  '|' )?
            command '}'

FUN_IDENT = '@' [A-Za-z_+-*/=!%^&amp;&gt;&lt;]+

VAR_IDENT = '$' [A-Za-z_]+
</pre>
	

<h3>Commands</h3>

<p> This is a language focused on text editing, so the core of it is built
around buffers. All of the language constructs implicitly work on
a buffer. Within the buffer, you have a <em>focus</em>. The focus is
the current location of the cursor. The interesting bit, though, is 
that the cursor isn't necessarily <em>between</em> two characters. It can
span over a range of text, all of which is under the cursor. In other words,
the the currently selected range of text and the cursor are the same thing.</p>


<p> Commands all work in terms of either moving the cursor, or modifying the
contents of the cursor. Most commands have a long name, and a short
abbreviated name.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><b>Cursor Motion</b></dt>

  <dd><dl>
      <dt><b>Pattern Search</b>: <code>s+/pattern/</code></dt>
      <dd> Moves the cursor so that it covers the next instance of the
	pattern in the current buffer. Returns the start position of the
	match. There's also a "s-" version, which looks for the previous
	instance of the match.</dd>
  
      <dt> <b>move</b>: <code><em>number</em> m <em>unit</em></code></dt>
      <dd> Moves the cursor by a specified distance. The units are 
	<code>c</code> (for characters), <code>l</code> (for lines),
	or <code>p</code> (for pages). So <code>3ml</code> means
	"move the cursor" forward three lines. Returns the start
	position of the cursor after the move.</dd>
  
      <dt> <b>jump</b>: <code><em>number</em> j <em>unit</em></code></dt>
      <dd> Jumps the cursor to a specific position. The units are the same
	as for the <code>m</code> command, where "character" units 
	specify column numbers. Returns the </dd>

      <dt><b>extend</b>: <code>e <em>motion-command</em></code> </dt>
      <dd> Extend cursor. The cursor is extended by the effect of the
	following command. So, for example, since <code>3mc</code> is a
	command that means "move the cursor forward three
	characters, <code>3emc</code> is a command that means "extend the
	cursor forward by three characters - it moves the end-point of the
	cursor forward by three, without changing the
	start. <code>-3eml</code> adds the previous three lines to the
	cursor. <code>es+/foo/</code> extends the cursor to include the
	next match for "foo".</dd>

      <dt><b>pick</b>: <code>(expr, expr)p</code></dt>
      <dd> Selects a range of text as the current cursor. Each
	expression is interpreted as a
	location.  <code>(3lj,4pj)p</code> covers the range from the
	beginning of the third line, to the end of the fourth page.
	<code>(s+/foo/, s+/bar/)p</code> covers the range from the beginning
	of the first match of "foo" to the end of the first match of
	"bar".</dd>
      
      <dt><b>selectall</b>: <code>*</code></dt>
      <dd> Makes the current cursor cover the entire buffer.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Edits</b></dt>
  <dd><dl>
      <dt><b>delete</b>: <code>d</code></dt>
      <dd> Delete the contents of the cursor. If it's followed by a variable
	name, then the deleted text is inserted into that variable.</dd>
  
      <dt><b>copy</b>: <code>c$var</code></dt>
      <dd> Copy the contents of the selection into a variable.</dd>
  
      <dt><b>insert</b>: <code>i'text'</code> </dt>
      <dd> Inserts text <em>before</em> the cursor. The quote character can
	actually be any character: the first character after an <code>i</code>
	is the delimiter, and the insert string runs to the next instance
	of that delimiter.</dd>
  
      <dt><b>append</b>: <code>a'text'</code></dt>
      <dd> Appends text <em>after</em> the cursor. Quotes work just like
	<code>i</code>.</dd>
      
      <dt><b>replace</b>: <code>r'text'</code></dt>
      <dd> Replaces the current contents of the cursor with the new
	text.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Control Flow</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>global</b>: <code>g/pattern/,block</code></dt>
      <dd> A simple loop construct. For each match of the pattern within
	the current cursor, execute the block. So, for example,
	to do a global search and replace of foo with bar,
	<code>* g/foo/,{r'bar'}</code>.</dd>

      <dt><code>stmt ^ stmt</code></dt>
      <dd> Choice/logical or statement: any statement can either succeed or 
	fail. <code>^</code> allows you to combine statements so that the 
	second one only executes if the first one fails. The statement
	as a whole succeeds if either the first or second statement
	succeeds. Ret turns the value of the statement that succeeds.</dd>
      <dt><code>stmt &amp; stmt</dt>
      <dd> Sequencing/logical and. The second statement will only be executed
	if the first one succeeds, and the entire statement succeeds only
	if both succeed. Returns the value of the second statement.</dd>
      <dt><code>( stmt )</code></dt>
      <dd> Should be obvious, eh?</dd>
      <dt><code> stmt1 ? stmt2 : stmt3</code></dt>
      <dd>If-then-else. A simple if-then without an else is just 
	a <code>,</code> sequence. You can get an if-then-else effect
	without this, but it's tricky enough to justify adding this.</dd>
      <dt><b>loop</b>: <code>l{block}</code></dt>
      <dd> A general loop. Executes the block over and over as long as it
	succeeds.</dd>
      <dt><b>execute</b>: <code>x <em>block</em></code></dt>
      <dd> Executes the block on the current cursor. The contents of
	the current cursor becomes the target buffer of the body of the
	block, and the cursor is set to position 0 of that target buffer.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>

  <dt><b>Variables</b></dt>

  <dd><dl>
      <dt><code>$ident</code></dt>
      <dd> Any symbol starting with a <code>$</code> is a variable. In
	an expression, a variable name evaluates to its value.</dd>
  
      <dt><b>set!</b>: <code>expr!$ident</code></dt>
      <dd> Assign the result of executing the preceeding expression to a
	variable. If the variable is already defined in this scope, or in any
	enclosing scope, update it; otherwise, create a new local variable.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  
  <dt><b>External Interaction</b></dt>
  <dd><dl>
      <dt><code>&lt;'shellcommand'</code></dt>
      <dd>Execute <code>shellcommand</code> in an external shell, and
	insert the standard out from the command into the position at
	the start of the current cursor; then set the cursor to cover
	the inserted text.</dd>
      <dt><code>&lt;&lt;'shellcommand'</code></dt>
      <dd>Some as the &lt; command, except that it also inserts the contents
	of stderr from the shell command.</dd>

      <dt><code>|'shellcommand'</code></dt>
      <dd>Execute <code>shellcommand</code>, with the current cursor as
	its standard input, and replace the contents of the cursor with
	the standard output.</dd>

      <dt><code>||'shellcommand'</code></dt>
      <dd>Same as <code>|</code>, except that it also inserts the contents
	of stderr.</dd>
    </dl>
    </dd>

  <dt><b>I/O</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>write</b>: <code>w</code></dt>
      <dd> Write the current buffer out to a file. If no filename is
	specified, then use the buffer's associated filename. If a
	filename is specified, then write it to that file, and update
	the buffer's filename to match the written name.</dd>

      <dt><b>open</b>: <code>o'filename'</code></dt>
      <dd> Open a file in a new buffer.</dd>

      <dt><b>revert</b>: <code>v</code></dt>
      <dd> Discard all changes to this buffer.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Expressions</h3>

<p> In general, any command is also usable an expression. Every command
returns a value: motion commands return the new cursor position; edit
commands return any deleted text, or the size of the change.</p>

<p> Control statements don't depend on true and false values; instead,
  they're defined in terms of success and failure. Any statement can succeed
  or fail.</p>

<p> Arithmetic is done using built-in functions.</p>

<h3>Blocks</h3>

<p> A lot of statements take <em>block</em> parameters. A block is
  an executable code fragment. Blocks are enclosed in braces. They
  always implicitly take the current cursor as a parameter. In the
  case of the "x" and "g" commands, the block is executed using
  the current selection as if it were the entire buffer. In addition
  to the selection, a block can take additional parameters. They're written
  by enclosing them in "|"s at the beginning of the block. For example,
  you could define a block that returned the sum of its parameters
  by writing:</p>

<pre>
  {|$x, $y| ($x,$y)@+ }
</pre>

<p> Parameters for a block <em>preceed</em> its call. So to invoke the 
block above, you could use: <block>(3,2)x{|x,y| (x,y)@+)}</block>, which
would then return 5.</p>

<p> Blocks are lexically scoped; a block declared inside of another block
can access variables from that enclosing block.  </p>

<p> You can declare named subroutine. A named subroutine is mostly
syntactic sugar  for a block. The main difference is that if you go to
the trouble of creating a named subroutine, then you can declare both
prefix and postfix parameters.  The names of named subroutines always start with an "@" symbols. A named subroutine just associates a
 global name with a block. </p>

<pre>
  fun ($x) @fact {(x,0)@= ? {1} : { (x, (x,1)@-@fact)@* }
</pre>
  
<p> When calling a block, the parameters preceed it. So to get the
  factorial of 10, you'd write <code>10@fact</code>.</p>

<p> For numeric arguments to commands, you can just put the expression
  before the command instead of a number. For example, to move to line
  fact(4), you'd write: <code>4@fact jl</code>. For string parameters
  that appear in quoted positions, if you use an "$()" instead of a quote
  character, then the contents are evaluated as an expression, and the
  result is used as the string parameter value. So to insert
  the <em>string</em> "5@fact", you could
  write <code>i'5@fact'</code>. To insert the result of evaluating it,
  you'd write "<code>i$(5@fact)</code>".</p>
