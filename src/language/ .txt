<p> One thing I've been hearing a lot lately on the radio, both on my
local news station and on NPR, has been really ticking me off, and since the
reason that it's bugging is mathematical, it's at least sort-of relevant for
this blog.</p>

<p> I keep hearing things like the following, which is my approximate transcript of something I heard on NPR today (sorry, I didn't catch
the name of the speaker):</p>

<blockquote>
what these liberal economists, like Krugman, are missing when it comes
to unemployment is that we're dealing with a structural problem. Government
programs can't help with that.
</blockquote>

<p> What this doubletalk is about is: when you study unemployment, there are two fundamental kinds of unemployment. There's cyclical unemployment, which
is related to the business cycle, and there's structural unemployment, which isn't.</p>

<p> To simplify rather dramatically: In cyclical unemployment, the cause is the basic business cycle. When the economy contracts because of a recession, businesses have excess capacity - that is, they have the capability to produce <em>more</em> than customers can buy. So they get rid of the parts of that
excess capacity that are easy to replace. That translates, mostly, as "people": rather than paying people to sit around and do nothing, they lay off
workers. When things improve, they can always hire new people, and if you expect that you're not going to need people for a reasonable period of time, firing people now and then hiring and training new people later is cheaper that keeping the trained people on the payroll. </p>

<p> Structural unemployment is more like an impedance mismatch. The idea is
that you've got lot of available jobs, and lots of available workers - but the
available workers can't fill the jobs. Typically, there's been some kind of
dramatic change in the economy, and as a result, some industries required
output is permanently smaller, but some other industries are growing. Most of
the time, structural unemployment is caused by skill mismatches. It's a
situation like the economy is growing rapidly in high-tech hardware, so you've
got a ton of jobs for electrical engineers. But the people in the workforce
without jobs are highly skilled but unemployed construction workers. You can't
hire the construction workers to be electrical engineers: they'd need several
years of college to acquire the basic skills that they'd need to do the
job.</p>

<p> When you're looking at an economic situation, you can differentiate between the two fairly easily. In cyclical unemployment, people lost their jobs because their employers had excess capacity. In structural, people
also lost their jobs because of excess capacity - but the reason for that
excess capacity is that their product just isn't needed anymore by the economy.  But there's some other industry that really needs people, but the
unemployed people don't meet their requirements.</p>

<p> So you can distinguish between them by looking at the job market. In structural unemployment, you'll have large numbers of job openings. You'll find wages in some geographic or industrial area rising dramatically, because
they're competing for a small group of people who meet the requirements for
the jobs. You'll see industries where the price of their products are rising, because they don't have sufficient capacity - they can't meet the demand, because they can't hire workers.</p>
